76. The bacterium Serratia marcescens has a red color when grown on nutrient agar, due to 
its production of a secreted pigment called prodigiosin. There are multiple genes 
involved in the synthesis pathway for prodigiosin. A microbiologist mutates a culture of 
S. marcescens with ultraviolet light and identifies 4 different colonies that are auxotrophs 
(no longer produce the red pigment).  Auxotrophs are pink/orange, while the wild-type 
strain is dark red in color. However, S. marcescens auxotrophs can secrete and take up 
intermediate products of the biosynthesis pathway. For example, an intermediate 
molecule in the biosynthesis pathway can be secreted by auxotroph Strain A and taken 
up by auxotroph Strain B, if the two strains are grown close together on an agar plate.  If 
auxotroph Strain B has the correct enzymes to process the intermediate molecule into 
prodigiosin, Strain B will regain the dark red color. Auxotroph Strains A to D were grown 
in pairs, with the resulting colors. Select the statements below which is TRUE about the

100. A botanist takes a fresh spinach leaf and uses a hole-punch to create “leaf punches” for 
further experimentation. The botanist uses a syringe to create a vacuum and remove air 
trapped inside a sample of leaf punches. Next, the botanist sets up two cups, each under 
a white light that is suitable for photosynthesis.  The cups are filled half-full with water; 
ten leaf disks are placed in each cup and sink to the bottom. In Cup A, the botanist takes 
a straw and exhales her breath for 1 minute while blowing bubbles into the water. To 
Cup B, nothing further is added.  Then, she switches on the white lights above each cup. 
Eight minutes later, the botanist observes that in Cup A, 7 leaf disks have floated to the 
top of the cup; no leaf disks have yet floated to the surface in Cup B.  Small bubbles are 
observed on the margins of the leaf punches in Cup A. Based on what you know about 
plant metabolism, select all of the following statements below that are TRUE? Note:  O2 
is less soluble in water than CO2. 
A. If the botanist switched off the lights at 8 minutes, additional leaf disks would be 
expected to rise in Cup A for the first few minutes, since the dark reactions can 
continue in the absence of light. 
B. If the botanist switched off the lights at 8 minutes, eventually the disks in Cup A 
would begin to sink, due to cellular respiration in the plant cells.
